# [To-Do List for mobile](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jCM-AvclF-ESicv4efNV_5jpq22ft2Zb/view)
This is a to-do list made with React Native. I've used some external libs for using more mobile features. The project have been set only for mobile. If you want to download the apk and test it on your smartphone, just click in the title link and you will be redirected to google drive download link.  

## In case of cloning reposiry
If you want to test it, you will need to run those commands at the root of the project:  
```npm install```  
```npx react-native link```  
```cd android``` ```./gradlew clean```  
```cd ..``` ```npm run android```  
I've used Android Studio to test it.

### Enjoy!
